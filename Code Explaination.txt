The "RecentlyPlayedSongsStore" class has a constructor that takes an integer capacity as an argument, 
which represents the maximum number of songs that can be stored per user. 

It also has two methods:

	- "recordSong(String user, String song)" : 
			Records a song that was played by a user. 
			If the user has already played capacity songs, the least recently played song is removed. 
			This method is synchronized to ensure that it is thread-safe.
	
	
	- "getRecentSongs(String user)" : 
			Retrieves the list of capacity most recently played songs for a given user. 
			If the user has not played any songs, an empty list is returned. 
			This method is also synchronized.
			
			
To test the logic, you can use a testing framework like JUnit and write some test cases. 

The "RecentlyPlayedSongsStoreTest" class has following methods to test the use-cases

The "setUp()" method creates a new RecentlyPlayedSongsStore object with a capacity of 3. 

The "testEmptyList()" method tests that an empty list is returned when there are no 
	recently played songs for a user. 

The "testRecordAndGetSongs()", 
	"testRecordAndGetSongs2()", 
	"testRecordAndGetSongs3()", 
	"testRecordAndGetSongs4()" 
	method records some songs played by Tilak and tests that the list of recent songs 
	returned by the "getRecentSongs()" method is correct.
